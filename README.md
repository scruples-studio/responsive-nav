# Responsive Nav JS, SASS version

This takes the [Responsive Nav JS](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js) (also [here](https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js)) and converts it into a reusable SASS component. 

- Opinionated; builds on the Scruples starter CSS and contains CSS variables used in the Scruple Statamic [starter](https://github.com/scruples-studio/starter)
- Most dimensions and other values that can change on a per-project basis can be edited as SASS variables.
- Contains placeholder SVG icon as well as basic animated CSS-only hamburger icon ([Codepen demo](https://codepen.io/colinlewis/pen/JjNYweE))
