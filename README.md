This takes the [Responsive Nav JS](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js) (also [here](https://github.com/samikeijonen/responsive-nav.js)) and converts it into a reusable SASS component. 

- Opinionated; builds on the Scruples starter CSS.
- Most dimensions and other values that can change on a per-project basis can be edited as SASS variables.
